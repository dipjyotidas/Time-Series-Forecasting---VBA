# Time-Series-Forecasting---VBA
This is the code in VBA for Forecasting a single Metric (Demand v/s Time) using Holt's Winter Multiplicative Time series decomposition analysis and by using solver functionality for optimization of the smoothing constants. The data is imported from database - SQL server to a csv file with column fields as Grouping_ID, Grouping_Name, Year_Code, Month_Code, Period and Metric. The user has to enter the number of periods(future months) to forecast. It can forecast for any number of periods for any number of Grouping_IDs. After the calculation it displays the forecasting trend graph for each Grouping_ID in a separate tab.
